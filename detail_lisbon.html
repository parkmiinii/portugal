                    <p>São Jorge Castle is one of the oldest buildings in Lisbon and is the main historical monument and tourist attraction in Lisbon. The castle was built on the high point of the Alfama region and was the fortress when the Moors occupied Lisbon in the Middle Ages. Because it is located on a commanding hillside, it can be seen from almost every corner of Lisbon. The castle originally belonged to the earlier Visigoths. After the Moors invaded, it underwent a large-scale expansion. The 8-meter-thick city wall still makes people feel extraordinary. Here one can better appreciate the city's architectural art, whether it's the futuristic castle and drawbridge from Alfama to the city in the distance, or the open-air ruins of the Carmo church in the city. </p>

                    <p>It is located about 2 kilometers southwest of the old town of Cascais. A hole is formed on a 30-meter cliff, the waves of the Atlantic beat against the cliff, and the sea water pours in from the hole, which makes people feel the magic of nature. The waves of the Atlantic Ocean are even more frightening because of the cliffs and a deep hole in the cliffs. There is a small red-roofed house on the top. An old man is waiting here to welcome local and foreign tourists who come here from time to time. Standing on the shore, I saw the waves in the ocean rolling in, over the reefs near the shore, rolling out vortices one by one, and then furiously hitting the rocks and caves on the cliffs, making a deafening loud noise. Spectacular cliffs and huge waves and loud noises, hence the name.</p>
